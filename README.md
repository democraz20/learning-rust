learning rust </br>
project are not in order rather than in commit history </br>
currently working on : calculator </br>
## calculator
takes single input (string) and works on float (f64) type</br>
currently only has +,-,* and / operators </br>
```js
        vec.pop();
        vec.pop();
        vec.remove(0);
        let mut vec2: Vec<&str> = vec.clone();
        //vec2 is for using vec in an another loop
        //might be temp, kind of stupid
```
(needs cleaning up)
